# Features for 1.0.0 #

This page contains the features suggested by q4e users to be included (you can contribute more [in this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/q4e-users/browse_thread/thread/260d4a7c04d3316c)) in the 1.0.0 release.

It will serve for discussion and reference, although it will be eventually replaced by [tickets in the issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/q4e/issues/list?q=milestone%3A1.0.0).

## Integrate Maven and Eclipse plugins ##
### Support for integration between Maven and Eclipse RCP/Plugins ###

(Marcelo Alcantara)

_Need more info_

### Integrate `pom.xml` and `manifest.mf` ###
I'd love to see integration with the maven osgi plugin and some way to integrate pom.xml and plugin.xml/manifest.mf.

(Josh Suereth)

_Is this done by [maven-bundle-plugin](http://felix.apache.org/site/maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html)?_

### Resolve (bundle) dependencies on poms from Eclipse Runtime ###

The ability to depend on eclipse plugins from a maven-like repository (or treat your eclipse install as a maven repository)

(Josh Suereth)

## Open artifact search ##

For v1.0.0, I would love to see our artifact search integrated with
repository managers like archiva, etc ..

(Erle Mantos)

## Form based `pom.xml` editor ##
Form-based POM editor ala Manifest editor of eclipse.

(Erle Mantos)

_This has been in development since, at least 0.6.0... should be out before 1.0.0_

## Keyboard shortcuts ##
I would like to see keyboard shortcuts on
commonly used stuffs to be implemented in q4e. Developers are more on
keyboards rather than on mouse for faster development.

(Allan Ramirez)

## One way to clean ##
As long as mvn clean != Project -> Clean, I'd like to see 'clean' on
the context menu.  Project -> Clean seems to clean only classes and
test-classes.  In the case of war and ear packaging, they use build
directories which do not get cleaned.  So if a dependency or some file
is removed, it still exists in the build directory and will get
repackaged.  A proper clean has to be run by going to execute goal.

(Robert Dale)

## Nexus search ##
(Rodrigo Ruiz)

_Partial integration available on 0.7.0_

## Integration of commonly used eclipse plugins ##
Integration of some commonly used eclipse plugins on project import/
update: checkstyle-cs, PMD, findbugs, cobertura, etc. Maybe as
optional extensions, just like the dependency viewer.

When these tools are configured in the `pom.xml`, use the provided information to properly configure the eclipse plug-ins supporting those tools.

In other words, integrate with PMD, Checkstyle, FindBugs... eclipse plug-ins based on information in the `pom.xml`, just like it is done for _WTP_

## Maven suggestions also for site.xml files ##

For skin selection

(Rodrigo Ruiz)

## wysiwyg editor for apt documents ##

(Rodrigo Ruiz)

## Multimodule import on a single project ##
Being able to import a multimodule project in a single eclipse
project.
I know that this could have issues when there are weird dependencies
in the modules and also that it won't provide good isolation between
the modules, but I find **very** annoying when I checkout code I use for
reference and not for developing to have to allocate dozen projects to
it and not be able to use a single project like I do with m2eclipse.

(Stefano Bagnara)

## Show multi-module relationships ##

This proposed feature is in keeping with the goal of providing a more
visual nature for Maven users in Eclipse.

Similar to View Dependencies, this feature would produce a graphical
representation of the relationship between modules in a multi-module
build. This feature would help developers to quickly understand the
relationships involved in a multi-module build (dependency,
inheritance and aggregation).

For an example of the general nature of the graphical representation,
please consult the article referenced below, which summarizes the
graphical notation in Figure 7 -- A relationship graph. The graph
includes relationships for 'depends on', 'inherits from' and
'aggregates'.

Note that this graph would only need to show module dependencies,
since the existing View Dependencies already has addressed the general
artifact dependency graph.

This feature would be particularly useful for someone examining a
multi-module project build produced by others, because it would
quickly summarize all of the relationships in a single graphical view.

(Pat Podenski)

## SVN issues with multi-modules ##

  * When I run refactorings involving minor changes in all of the modules-projects Eclipse will do 1 commit for each module. So, first, it seems my commit is no more atomic.

  * When I move/copy code between different modules-project eclipse does not correctly handle the svn cp/rm stuff to preserve my history.

(Stefano Bagnara)

## Duplicated autogenerated names ##

  * Running the import of a multimodule already on my disk use the
module `artifactId` as eclipse project identifier. Sometimes `artifactId`
are identical in different projects. I found no way to tell q4e to use
`groupId+artifactId` or to use a prefix when importing a multimodule
project.

(Stefano Bagnara).

## Maven 2 POM Creation Wizard ##
It would be nice if there was a "Maven 2 POM Creation Wizard" for
creating an initial pom.xml file:
File -> New -> Other -> Maven 2 Project -> Maven 2 POM Creation Wizard

Additionally, the "Maven 2" context menu (in Package Explorer) is not
available unless the project has a pom.xml file. It would be nice if
the "Maven 2" context menu was available with the "Maven 2 POM
Creation Wizard" as an option (the only option?).

For exiting Q4E users these features are not a must, but I believe
that new users will find this a more intuitive way to add Maven
support to existing Java projects.
