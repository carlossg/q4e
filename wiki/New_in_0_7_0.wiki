  This feature uses the Open Artifact Search Framework outlined below.

== Always updated dependencies ==
  No need to `mvn install` the dependencies on the workspace when running maven goals. The most current version is always used.

  This means that you can modify a project on your workspace and use it in the surefire tests of a different one depending on it. Instantly. 

== Profile activation/deactivation == 
  The profile view allows for quickly enabling and disabling profiles when running maven.

  Several implementations are bundled with the install so you can use it out of the box.

== [DevelopingMojos Resolve Maven Mojos from the Workspace] ==
  It is possible to have maven mojo projects on the workspace and haven them used by q4e.

== [Archetype2ArchetypeProvider New Archetype Provider for the Archetype Catalog format] ==
  The archetype catalog xml format used by the archetype 2.0 plug-in can now be used with q4e for selecting an archetype in the [NewMavenProject New Maven Project wizard].

  This format is used to register an internal catalog by default, which replaces the wiki provider (although it can still be manually added).

== Upgraded embedder ==
  The new embedder contains support for new maven features (like the [http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Toolchains toolchain] support). And don't forget about the bug fixes.

= WTP support =

== J2EE Project Dependencies management ==
  Automatic synchronization of J2EE project dependencies from maven dependencies for war projects.

  All your dependencies in the workspace will be available when running the project on a J2EE server.
