= Introduction =

The maven-archetype plug-in defines an xml format for archetype catalogs, starting at version 2.0.

This format can be used with q4e, in addition to [CustomArchetypeList other archetype sources] to make archetypes available in the [NewMavenProject New Maven Project Wizard].


= Details =

The archetype-catalog format is defined in the [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-archetype-plugin/specification/archetype-catalog.html documentation for the maven-archetype plug-in].

New catalogs can be registered through the Prefereces. 

Check _Maven > Archetype Preferences_.

Select _New..._ and, on the drop down, choose _Archetype 2.0 Catalog_

Now you can choose to use the built-in catalog (it's configured by default, but in case you've deleted it, is easy to add again), a local catalog (a file on your filesystem) or a catalog located at a given URL.

Note that `file://` urls can be used for local files, but the _local catalog_ option provides a file browser which makes selection much easier.

If you're not sure if you typed the right url, press the _Validate_ button and the wizard will inform you if it is not available to read the catalog.
