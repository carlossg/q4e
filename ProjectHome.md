Eclipse IAM has been updated to **work with** Galileo (Eclipse 3.5) and to **use** some of the new projects on this eclipse release train. Ganymede users(Eclipse 3.4) should make sure they have added all the update sites listed in the [installation instructions](Installation.md).

Adopters of the latest and greatest Eclipse Galileo can install from the update site [as usual](Installation.md).

If upgrading from Q4E 0.8.1 or earlier, follow these [extra steps](UpgradingToEclipseIAM.md).

## May 6th, 2009: New major release 0.9.0 ##

After some work moving to the Eclipse Foundation we have made the first release of Eclipse IAM.

Major improvements are improved performance (less builds are triggered) and form based pom editors, with the ability of opening parent poms, effective pom, or settings file.

Read the [installation instructions](Installation.md) as we are using a new update site to avoid confusion with previous Q4E releases. If you are upgrading from a previous version of Q4E you will need to do [some extra steps](UpgradingToEclipseIAM.md)

See [what's new in 0.9.0](New_in_0_9_0.md)

## Dec 17th, 2008: New maintenance release 0.8.1 ##

While we walk the path to making Eclipse IAM snapshots available to you, we've released a new q4e release with a minor bugfix to behave more nicely with the central repository, reducing the number of downloads of the central index file.
Please install and help the maven repo maintainers conserve bandwidth.

## Codebase hosted at eclipse ##

The Eclipse Foundation has accepted q4e in their subversions. Development of q4e will now continue at [Eclipse IAM](http://eclipse.org/iam).

## Oct 16th, 2008: Q4E and Eclipse IAM at ApacheCon US and Eclipse Summit Europe ##

In the next weeks the project will be present at two important conferences where [Abel Mui単o](http://ramblingabout.wordpress.com/) and [Carlos Sanchez](http://blog.csanchez.org/2008/10/14/q4e-and-eclipse-iam-news-and-talks/) will be talking about the project features, status, future direction,...

**[Carlos Sanchez](http://csanchez.org/)**: **[Q4E and Eclipse IAM, Maven integration for Eclipse](http://us.apachecon.com/c/acus2008/sessions/51)**

"Q for Eclipse", now Eclipse IAM (Eclipse Integration for Apache Maven), is a new Open Source project that integrates Apache Maven and the Eclipse IDE for faster, more agile, and more productive development. The plugin allows you to run Maven from the IDE, import existing Maven projects without intermediate steps, create new projects using Maven archetypes, synchronize dependency management, search artifact repositories for dependencies that are automatically downloaded, view a graph of dependencies and more! Join us to discover how to take advantage of all these features, as well as how they can help you to improve your development process.
